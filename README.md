R Script showing graphical representation of data from the 2018 Department of Justice Criminal Victimization Paper


# Situation

I came across a visual that showed only portions of the information provided that resulted in a skewed approach to analyzing the data.
This approach to the displaying the data resulted in many individuals inferring information that they may not otherwise have. 
It is for this reason I decided to build a data frame and present these graphs for individuals to analyze and decide for themselves. 

# Dataset

The data provided is of the counts for victims and when possible, the ethnic representation of the individauls attacking the victim. The data included several other categories including "more than one group represented" and "not known or reported". These values were relatively low, being less then 3% across the board for individuals being attacked by more than one assailant, and the assailants not sharing a common ethinicity.

# Approach

I took the four most significant ethic groups reported as actors of violent crimes; white, black, hispanic, and asian. The original data set provided a raw total number of incidents for each ethnic group, and proportion values providing the proprtion of crimes committed by that victimized group by each of the four ethinic groups. 

# Observations

## Crime is most often a crime of opportunity

To paraphrase the economist William Easterly, "Oppression is a crime of opportunity". Most crimesare not committed by individuals who bother to drive half way across the country, let alone the city an hour away. Most violent crimes are committed by people in their area they live. At Least in the United States of America, most people live near people that they share similar ethinic backgrounds with. You can observe interesting statistics that resemble Simpson's Paradox in cities like Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Milwaukee simulataneously is one of the most diverse places and most segregated places ethniclly in America. This is confirmed in the aggregate data showing that most ethinicities are most harmed by members of their own ethnic group. 

Asian actors were the only group that did not show a statistically significant difference in their harming individuals of their own ethinc group more often than individuals of other ethnic groups. They were also the only group that did not follow the trend of the largest proportion of the actors being the same ethinicty as the victims. 

Continuing with opportunty, white and black numbers in my opinion provide ample information behind them concerning access, opportunity, and history of the nation.
